Blockchain Education Sessions

Giving the basic overview of DLT and Blockchain tech

Content: To be decided 

- Basics of Bitcoin & the Blockchain
- Navigating the Bitcoin ecosystem
- Wallets, security & cold storage
^ I think as the education sessions I organised / Matt (Portsmouth Crypto) ran at CoinFestUK were well received and draw a good crowd 
we base these workshops off these topics
